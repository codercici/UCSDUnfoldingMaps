==================================================================
This is the summary of the course, Object Oriented Programming in Java and Beyond offered by UCSD on coursera, which I completed during the winter break of 2017. I learnt the fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming, how to leverage the power of existing libraries, how to build graphical user interfaces, and how to use some core algorithms for searching and sorting data. Since this course is project-based, I used java to build several interactive maps that show the locations and routes of airports, the locations of earthquakes and the cities that they influenced.

EXAMPLES
==================================================================
UCSDUnfoldingMaps/src/module6/AirportMap.java
UCSDUnfoldingMaps/src/module6/EarthquakeCityMap.java

INSTALLATION
==================================================================
Import this folder in Eclipse ('File' -> 'Import' -> 'Existing Projects into
Workspace', Select this folder, 'Finish')

MANUAL INSTALLATION
==================================================================
If the import does not work follow the steps below.
- Create new Java project
- Copy+Paste all files into project
- Add all lib/*.jars to build path
- Set native library location for jogl.jar. Choose appropriate folder for your OS.
- Add data/ as src

TROUBLE SHOOTING
==================================================================
Switch Java Compiler to 1.6 if you get VM problems. (Processing should work with Java 1.6, and 1.7)
